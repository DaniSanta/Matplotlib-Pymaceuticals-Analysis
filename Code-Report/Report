•	After carefully analyzing the different drugs as well as the effect they have on the tumor size,
it was clear to see in specific how the Capomulin drug had one of the most impacts. It was the
drug with more regular used and had a positive impact in regards to decreasing the size of the tumors. For example, 
on average Capomulin was effective in decreasing the tumor volume (size) from 45mm t0 36.2mm.

•	We are able to see in the linear regresion model the correlation betweeen the mouse weight versus the 
average tumor volume for the Capomulin drug. We are able to see the positive relationship between the weight and 
the tumor (size). In other words, we are able to conclude that as the weight of the mouse increased the tumor volume (size)
increased as well. 

•	I also concluded that the Capomulin drug had a significant impact on certain mouses. For example, I took mouse l509 and creted a 
line plot with the data I gather from the csv files. I was able to compare the tumor volume (size) of specifically mouse l509 to
the change after receiving the Capomulin drug. After plotting the information we are able to see that within 35 days of treatment
the tumor size had decreased by more than 10%.
